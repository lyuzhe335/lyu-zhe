    "a) Understanding Classification Decision Trees\n",
    "Q: What type of problem does a Classification Decision Tree address?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Classification Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm designed to solve classification problems. These problems involve predicting a discrete, categorical outcome (e.g., yes/no, spam/ham, or multi-class labels). The tree works by recursively splitting the data based on feature values to create decision rules that classify data into specific categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of real-world applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical Diagnosis: Determining if a patient has a specific disease based on symptoms, test results, and other medical data.\n",
    "Customer Segmentation: Classifying customers into different categories, such as high-value or at-risk customers, based on their behavior and demographics.\n",
    "Fraud Detection: Identifying whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate using features like transaction amount, location, and time.\n",
    "Spam Detection: Classifying emails as spam or not spam based on their content, sender, and other metadata.\n",
    "Credit Risk Assessment: Predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default based on financial and personal data.\n",
    "Q: How does a Classification Decision Tree make (classification) predictions? How does this differ from Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Decision Tree:\n",
    "Decision Process:\n",
    "The tree starts at the root and splits the data at each node based on the most significant feature, determined by measures like Gini impurity or information gain.\n",
    "At the end of the tree, each terminal node (leaf) assigns a class label, representing the majority class of the samples in that node.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "A predicted class (e.g., \"Yes\" or \"No\") based on the majority rule or a probability distribution over all classes.\n",
    "Key Feature: Handles categorical and non-linear data well, using branching logic.\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Decision Process:\n",
    "It assumes a linear relationship between the features (independent variables) and the target (dependent variable).\n",
    "Predictions are computed by combining feature values using learned coefficients and adding a constant (intercept).\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "A continuous numerical value as the prediction, which is then compared to actual values to compute error metrics like RMSE.\n",
    "Key Feature: Works well for continuous, linearly related data but struggles with categorical outcomes without additional steps (e.g., converting to logistic regression for binary classification).\n",
    "In summary:\n",
