    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "A most beloved piece of [statistical lore](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2012.00620.x) about the (most famous) statistician Ronald Fisher involves cups of tea with milk. Fisher and his friend and colleague, Dr. Muriel Bristol, worked at Cambridge in the 1920s and regularly had tea together. During one of their afternoon tea times, Bristol refused a cup of tea from Fisher because he put milk in first BEFORE pouring in the tea. Bristol said she could taste the difference, and much preferred the taste of tea when the milk was poured in afterward the tea. Fisher didn't think that there could be a difference and proposed a hypothesis test to examine the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher made 8 cups of tea, 4 with milk added in first and 4 with tea added in first, and gave them to Dr. Bristol without her seeing how they were made and she would say if she thought the tea or the milk was poured first. As it turned out, Bristol correctly identified if the tea or milk was poured first for all 8 of the cups. Fisher, being a skeptical statistician wanted to test if this could be happening by chance with Bristol just randomly guessing (or whether there was evidence against an assumption of Bristol just randomly guessing), and subsequently designed a statistical hypothesis test to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you run an experiment like this with students in STA130. You get a random sample of 80 STA130 students to each taste one cup of tea and tell you whether they think the milk or tea was poured first. **Suppose 49 students are able to correctly state which was poured first.** Provide a statistical analysis of this experiment as guided through the following set of questions.\n",

    "    - which would likely involve the simulation of a sampling distribution under $H_0$ in order to estimate p-value with respect to the null hypothesis based on the observed test statistic (how?), concluding with the assement of $H_0$ based on an interpretation of the meaning of the p-value relative to $H_0$\n",

    "While the issues here are relatively advanced and subtle (as introduced [here](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~berger/p-values.html), presented [here](https://www.jarad.me/courses/stat587Eng/slides/Inference/I06-Pvalues/why_pvalues_dont_mean_what_you_think_they_mean.pdf), and demonstrated using simulation [here](https://jaradniemi.shinyapps.io/pvalue/)), the problem essentially comes down to the fact that most scientists (or just people) don't know how to really interpret the numeric value of a p-value. There are therefore two current proposed solutions to address this challenge.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Just interpreting p-values using the follwing table (which really isn't that hard, so it's surprising that this solution isn't more broadly adopted...)\n",

    "|-|-|\n",

    "|$$0.001 \\ge p$$|Very strong evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Only do **hypothesis testing** on the basis of confidence intervals, not **p-values** (which might be the best solution wherever doing so is a realistic, convenient  possibility...)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this quite broad introductory context in mind, what does your favorite ChatBot thinks about the following statements? \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Hypothesis testing is not a \"mathematical proof\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. We do not prove $H_0$ false, we instead give evidence against the $H_0$: \"We reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ, meaning we have ABC evidence against the null hypothesis\"\n",
    "    2. We do not prove $H_0$ is true, we instead do not have evidence to reject $H_0$: \"We fail to reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implying that a \"non-significant result\" means there is \"no effect\" misleads an audience because this may in actual fact simply indicate that there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So this therefore overlooks the possibility of sample size limitations, or Type II errors (which means a test incorrectly concludes that there is no effect or difference when, in fact, there is one). \n",
    "    \n",
    "> Similarly, analagously, a \"significant result\" used to reject the null hypothsis could alternatively be a Type I error (which means a test actually incorrectly rejected a null hypothesis when it was actually true)... we're only providing a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis... but the evidence could still incorrectly suggest the wrong conclusion... it really depends on how strong the evidence is...\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - all of which is why just interpreting p-values using the table above is a good idea...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The p-values used for hypothesis testing are contructed upone the assumptions of the null hypotheses they correspond to; but, null hypotheses are actually often presented in simple forms that routinely hide a lot of information that is implicitly used to construct the p-values. For example, distributional assumptions about the population, estimated \"plug-in\" values that can used to simplify the problem calculations, and the reliance upon \"random sampling\", etc...<br><br>\n",
    "           \n",
    "4. Drawing overly broad conclusions, or making recommendations based on findings that reject the null hypothesis in a specific context is fraught with the problematic risks of overgeneralization errors. Further exacerbating this issue, null hypotheses are typically so called \"point null hypotheses\" which is meant to emphasize that they are mathematically increadibly sharply specific; whereas, alternative hypotheses are usually very unspecific. An alternative hypothesis that \"the null hypothesis is false\" doesn't say much... we should wonder, \"how, specfically, is the null false?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "As an example really giving a demonstrating this, consider rejecting a null hypothesis that there is no correlation between rain and pizza's delivered. Such a decision doesn't specify what the actual hypothetical correlation might be. In fact, it doesn't even indicate if there are more or less pizzas delivered when it rains... \n",

    "> - a confidence interval provides a range of plausible values of what the parameter in question might be; whereas, ...\n",
    "> - trying to more clearly address what the plausible values of the parameter in question might be on the basis of hypothesis testing would require conducting further experiements to continously reject increasingly detailed hypothesies to narrow down what the alternative hypothesis might actually include... which would indeed be an utterly vapid misuse of the intended purpose of hypothesis testing entrprise... \n",
